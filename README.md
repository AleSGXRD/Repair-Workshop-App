<h1>Repair Workshop App</h1>
This application has been my own project to learn about Angular and NodeJS, where I worked both on the server side and on the client side.

This has been focused on small workshops that require an application to speed up the data processing of their orders and even that of their clients.

<h2>FRONTEND</h2>
This was implemented with Angular using the MVC design pattern, where you can relate all the functionalities created in the BACKEND to the views, for the client's use.

<h2>BACKEND</h2>
This is a simple server created with NodeJS using Express, a SQLite database and relying on the Prisma ORM for the generation and control of the database, creating a CRUD for it, and even JsonWebToken to allow only users of the platform to be able to enter and is not accessible to any user.

<h3>Views</h3>
1- View where all the data of an order is collected<br>
